            Hi there! My name is Ian Waites and I am currently attending the Code Fellows 201 Course. We were given the assignment to create an About Me page and this is what I came up with.
          </p>
          <p id="aboutP">
            I made the decision to enroll into Code Fellows to really take the time and focus on learning JavaScript. So far I am a week into the program and it has not let me down, I have been learning a lot. I can only imagine how much more is to come in the following weeks and am excited for the opportunity.
          </p>
          <p id="aboutP">
            When I complete the program I will look forward to getting back into the work scene and will feel a lot more confident with JavaScript added to my resume. I would really love to get a job working at a company within the video game industry and manage their web sites (either internal or external facing), some of the companies I want to apply for are Bungie, 343 Industries, Twitch, Valve, and XBox.

              I have been working in the Tech industry for the past 6 years, mostly as a Web Producer and SharePoint Developer/Administrator. I have been lucky to be part of some cool teams over the years and have worked with compies ranging from Microsoft to small start ups and everything in between.

              A high profile public facing project I was a big part of is over at Microsoft Volume Licensing. I was part of a big revamp of their site which included moving tons of content and updating the layout and design while working in a new proprietary CMS. You can see the work I did here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing">Microsoft Licensing</a>.
